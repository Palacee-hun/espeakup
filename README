espeakup connector
=======================

This is very early alpha software, so please keep that in mind if you
use this program.

espeakup is a program which makes it possible for speakup to use
the espeak software synthesizer.  It does this by reading speakup's
softsynth device and passing the text to espeak which actually speaks.

Requirements
============

This program works with the speakup screen reader, which can be obtained
from http://linux-speakup.org, and the espeak software speech
synthesizer which can be obtained from http://espeak.sourceforge.net.
You must have both of these installed and operational.  Setting them up
is beyond the scope of this document.

Installation
============

To install espeakup, first cd into the directory where you
unpacked the tarball, then issue make to compile the program.  Once this
is done, as root, issue make install.  This will install espeakup in /usr/bin.

Starting up
===========

This program should be run after speakup is set up to communicate with a
software synthesizer and after /dev/softsynth exists.  Currently it does
not accept any command line options, so invoke it as follows:

/usr/sbin/espeakup

Questions
=========

You can contact me with questions, bugs, patches, etc, at
w.d.hubbs@gmail.com or on the speakup mailing list.

Thanks, and I hope you find this useful.
